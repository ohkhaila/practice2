      This site will serve as a space for fellows to find code from lessons, practice exercises, examples of good code, and also a tracker for the fellows experience over the years!
      It might also be a way for me to continue checking in with coding and preparing for the lessons and questions that I will get from fellows... actually it's mostly that.
